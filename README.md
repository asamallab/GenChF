The central question we address in this work is whether that enrichment is due to certain sub-types of NCFs. 
We analyze BFs extracted from a large dataset of reconstructed Boolean models from the BBM benchmark dataset, MCBF dataset, and Harris dataset, and find that generalized chain functions are significantly enriched within the NCFs. 

### code
- BF_checkers: Code to check whether a BF is one of the biologically meaningful types including chain-0, chain-1, and generalized chain functions.
- BF_generators: Code to generate biologically meaningful types of BFs including chain-0, chain-1 and generalized chain functions. 
- BF_properties: Code needed for BF_generators and BF_checkers.
- Chain functions final nb: Contains all the code to reproduce the plots provided in the manuscript
- compute_p_vals: Code to compute the statistical significance of the relative enrichments of the chain-0, chain-1, and generalized chain functions within the NCFs in the reference biological datasets.

### data
Contains all the data necessary for reproducing the results in this manuscript.
