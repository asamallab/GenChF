* BF_properties: computes different properties of Boolean functions. (file derived from https://github.com/asamallab/MCBF)
* BF_checkers: checks whether a given BF satisfies biologically meaningful properties. (file derived from https://github.com/asamallab/MCBF)
* BF_generators: generates a list of different types of BFs. (file derived from https://github.com/asamallab/MCBF)
We have two other notebooks 
* Chain functions final nb- This notebook contains all the codes needed to reproduce the results and plots in the paper
* compute p_vals nb- This is an R notebook containing the codes needed for the statistical tests we performed.
